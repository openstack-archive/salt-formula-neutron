=======================
Neutron Network Service
=======================

Neutron is an OpenStack project to provide "networking as a service" between
interface devices (e.g., vNICs) managed by other Openstack services (e.g.,
nova).

Starting in the Folsom release, Neutron is a core and supported part of the
OpenStack platform (for Essex, we were an "incubated" project, which means use
is suggested only for those who really know what they're doing with Neutron). 

Usage notes
===========

For live migration to work, you have to set migration param on bridge and
switch nodes.

.. code-block:: yaml

    neutron:
      bridge:
        enabled: true
        migration: true

.. code-block:: yaml

    neutron:
      switch:
        enabled: true
        migration: true

Furthermore you need to set private and public keys for user 'neutron'.

Documentation and Bugs
============================

To learn how to deploy OpenStack Salt, consult the documentation available
online at:

    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackSalt

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should be reported to
the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained the software from a 3rd party
operating system vendor, it is often wise to use their own bug tracker for
reporting problems. In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

    http://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-salt

Developers wishing to work on the OpenStack Salt project should always base
their work on the latest formulas code, available from the master GIT
repository at:

    https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/salt-formula-neutron

Developers should also join the discussion on the IRC list, at:

    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/openstack-salt

Development and testing
=======================

Development and test workflow with `Test Kitchen <http://kitchen.ci>`_ and
`kitchen-salt <https://github.com/simonmcc/kitchen-salt>`_ provisioner plugin.

Test Kitchen is a test harness tool to execute your configured code on one or more platforms in isolation.
There is a ``.kitchen.yml`` in main directory that defines *platforms* to be tested and *suites* to execute on them.

Kitchen CI can spin instances locally or remote, based on used *driver*.
For local development ``.kitchen.yml`` defines a `vagrant <https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-vagrant>`_ or
`docker  <https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-docker>`_ driver.

To use backend drivers or implement your CI follow the section `INTEGRATION.rst#Continuous Integration`__.

A listing of scenarios to be executed:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ kitchen list

  Instance                    Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action

  control-cluster-ubuntu-1404  Vagrant  SaltSolo     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>
  control-cluster-ubuntu-1604  Vagrant  SaltSolo     Inspec    Ssh        Set Up
  control-cluster-centos-71    Vagrant  SaltSolo     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>
  control-single-ubuntu-1404   Vagrant  SaltSolo     Inspec    Ssh        Verified
  control-single-ubuntu-1604   Vagrant  SaltSolo     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>
  control-single-centos-71     Vagrant  SaltSolo     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>

The `Busser <https://github.com/test-kitchen/busser>`_ *Verifier* is used to setup and run tests
implementated in `<repo>/test/integration`. It installs the particular driver to tested instance
(`Serverspec <https://github.com/neillturner/kitchen-verifier-serverspec>`_,
`InSpec <https://github.com/chef/kitchen-inspec>`_, Shell, Bats, ...) prior the verification is executed.


Usage:

.. code-block:: shell

 # list instances and status
 kitchen list

 # manually execute integration tests
 kitchen [test || [create|converge|verify|exec|login|destroy|...]] [instance] -t tests/integration

 # use with provided Makefile (ie: within CI pipeline)
 make kitchen
